# Codex Working Agreements

## Task tracking
- Track modernization tasks in `docs/tasks/` using numeric prefixes (e.g., `001-modernizing-droplet.md`).
- Keep README updates aligned with the tasks so operators can follow a consistent checklist.

## Documentation workflow
- If deployment instructions change, update both the README and the relevant task file.
- Prefer concrete, step-by-step deployment guidance over high-level descriptions.

## Creative direction (persistent prompt)
You're world class web designer and expert front-end engineer, take my requests and treat it like you've been hired to work on this project.
