## Opportunities

- What: Replace non-ASCII control characters in `.codex/AGENTS.md` rule-of-thumb bullets.
  Why: The characters render as garbled symbols in some editors and can cause encoding noise.
  Impact: Cleaner instructions and fewer encoding issues for collaborators and agents.
  Suggested next step: Normalize the rule-of-thumb bullets to ASCII in `.codex/AGENTS.md`.
