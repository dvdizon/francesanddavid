# 003 - Timeline Experience Refresh

## Summary
Refresh the homepage into a timeline-style, full-bleed storytelling experience that prioritizes wedding highlights, the autoplay wedding film, the engagement story, and the couple's college memories, while keeping wedding details as a subtle reference at the end.

## Source prompt
"You're world class web designer and expert front-end engineer, take my requests and treat it like you've been hired to work on this project. Add this prompt to AGENTS.md as a prompt moving forward for future changes. Don't forget to add a task file for this.

Looking at website _like_ https://www.lightshiprv.com/, the flow of the website are full width images and as you scroll down, you are met with videos, other images, story snippets, and just generally an engaging experience both for desktop and mobile. Do not, I repeat, do not just copy the words or images from the lightshiprv.com website. I am only referencing that website as an inspiration for how the images changes sizes and focus as the user scrolls through the page. We're not trying to sell a wedding or experience- we're telling a story of a couple who met in college, got engaged, then were married. It's been 10 years since the wedding, so we are trying to redesign this website like a timeline memory that the couple will update in the future, as they progress through their life.

In terms of order of things to show, I want it in this order:
- The wedding highlights, there are a few wedding highlight pictures _already_ provided, so make use of those.
- The wedding video autoplaying from the vimeo embedding, this working as autoplay on the site before, so look at history.
- The engagement photo, which is currently the "hero" image at the top of the page, which includes a narrative text like: "When Frances moved back home from Massachusetts, David promised to keep her close—and he proposed."
- Then lastly, how David and Frances met in college, and their favorite memories.
- At the very bottom, have the wedding details linked, but do not emphasize it, and just have it as a reference, as well as a link to the wedding program (program.html)

Styling wise, I don't like the font used. I want a modern font like F37Bolton, sans-serif, whichever is free of use by the public.

I want to make the background white, with black as the font color so it provides contrast, and just use the red that's already in place as nice accents to borders, button backgrounds, but make it more subtle.

Cite this prompt in the task file that you're creating."
