# Task 017: PR description formatting skill

## Summary
- Add a Codex skill that prevents mangled PR descriptions by using real newlines with `gh pr create`/`gh pr edit`.

## Checklist
- [x] Create the skill folder and SKILL.md in the repository.
- [x] Confirm the skill matches the desired behavior for CLI PR descriptions.

## Decisions
- Store the skill under `.codex/skills/` to keep Codex-specific guidance with the repo.
