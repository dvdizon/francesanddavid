# 002 - Visual direction options + asset planning

## Goal
Provide three distinct visual directions (Editorial Minimal, Cinematic Romantic, Modern Photo-First), align on the preferred direction, and list the photo assets needed to finalize the redesign.

## Why this matters
The redesign should feel contemporary while staying true to the wedding story. Picking a direction early keeps layout, typography, and imagery consistent.

## Plan
1. Draft three direction samples with palettes, typography, and layout cues.
2. Confirm the chosen direction with Frances and David.
3. Request and catalog needed photos (hero, proposal, venue, story moments, gallery highlights).
4. Apply the selected direction to the homepage and program page.
5. QA the story flow on desktop + mobile breakpoints.

## Deliverables
- Direction sample notes and approved selection.
- Finalized asset list with filenames or sources.
- Updated homepage + program page styles.
