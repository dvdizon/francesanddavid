# Task 009: Localize Flickr photo journal

## Summary
Replace the Flickr-driven photo journal with a locally hosted gallery so the images live in the repo and are referenced directly from the page.

## Checklist
- [x] Download the Flickr photos into `assets/images/flickr`.
- [x] Replace the Flickr JSON feed with a static gallery in `views/index.html`.
- [x] Keep the lightbox + isotope behaviors working with the local images.
