# 004 - Codex Preview Port Guidance

## Goal
Mention that automated previews/screenshots should use the correct host/port to avoid “Not Found”.

## Tasks
- [ ] Update local dev guidance to keep port 3000 while binding 0.0.0.0.
- [ ] Align Windows examples with port 3000.
- [ ] Document preview instructions for agents to avoid port 8000.

## Notes
Codex preview proxies reserve port 8000; use 3000 for this project when running previews.
